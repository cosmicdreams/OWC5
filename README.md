Overnight Website Challenge Twin Cities 2013

We'll be building a website for a local non-profit in 24 hours.  In years past,
we've attempted to build the entire website during the challenge.  This year
we're going to start early and build the base of the website so we can decorate
it for our non-profit during the event.

Here's a list of key features that we've determined we need to build before the
event:

* Donation Forms
* Media Managment
  * Import Media
  * Use Media while creating content

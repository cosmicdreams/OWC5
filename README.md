Overnight Website Challenge Twin Cities 2013

We'll be building a webiste for a local non-profit in 24 hours.  In years past, we've attempted to build the entire website during the challenge.  This year we're going to start early and build the base of the website so we can decorate it for our non-profit during the event.
